## MPCR TESTING

### OBJECTIVE

* To develop code according to the Process flow
* To design a External Interrupt Based Code which will Start and Stop the System
* To Collect and compare Temperature Readings of two Chambers  with their Threshold Values
* To Repeat the above process for 10 iterations

#### COMPONENTS

* Thermocouple AD595 (1)
* Push Buttion (1)
* SG 90 Servo Motors (2)

#### Pin Configuration
