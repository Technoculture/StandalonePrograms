## MPCR WITH CAN BUS (MASTER)

#### OBJECTIVE

* To control the System Remotely via command given by Master

* To Send START /STOP Command to slave in Real-time

* To get the current status of Process connected to slave via CAN Communication

* To design a finite state machine with different transition states.

### Serial Monitor Output

<u>IDLE MODE</u>: In this state Slave sends Idle status to Master and Master receives that Can msg
![mpcr can](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95620523/149616880-2d70f512-ad49-4f78-975e-4f63607ad52d.PNG)



<u>RUNNING MODE</u>: In this State an interrupt connected to master is being trigerred externally in response to which Master sends "Start" command to Slave.
Accordingly Slave Moves to Running State and Starts the Process and keeps Sending Status to master.

<u>COMPLETE MODE</u>: In this state the process terminates naturally and slave then sends Complete command to master and both transit in Idle state

<u>STOP MODE:</u> In this state the process is externally interrupted, and the masters sends Stop Command to Slave.
In response to that slave interrupts the process and sets all parameters to initial and then transits to Idle mode
