## DNA EXTRACTOR WITH CAN BUS (SLAVE)

#### OBJECTIVE

* To control the System Remotely via command given by Master

* To receive START /STOP Command from master in Real-time

* To execute and send the current status of Process to master via CAN Communication

* To design a finite state machine with different transition states.

* To Run the system for Six iterations by setting Servos to different angular positions
